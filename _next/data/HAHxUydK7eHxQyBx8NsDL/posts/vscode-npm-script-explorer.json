There is a neat little feature included in VS Code, that is quite useful but disabled by default. The \"NPM Script Explorer\". It simply displays all available scripts from your <code>package.json</code> and makes them executable via a button click.</p>\n<p>To enable the NPM Script Explorer, go to VS Code Settings (<code>File > Preferences > Settings</code>). Search for \"npm.enableScriptExplorer\" and enable the setting \"Npm: Enable Script Explorer\". That's all there is to it. Now you can simply execute them, by clicking on the corresponding play button.</p>\n","url":"https://zlypher.github.io/posts/vscode-npm-script-explorer"}},"__N_SSG":true}
