Another one of those scanners - and pretty new at that - is [webhint.io](https://webhint.io). It features an online scanner as well as a cli tool (neatly packaged via npm) which you can run locally or on your build servers.\n\nCurrently, it tests for various issues in the categories:\n* Accessibility\n* Interoperability\n* PWA\n* Performance\n* Security\n\nBut will it kill/replace Lighthouse and similar tools? Frankly, I don't know and I am not 100% convinced about it yet either. But it definitely looks promising, so keep an eye on it!\n\n**Resources**\n* [webhint.io](https://webhint.io)","url":"https://www.tompka.io/posts/webhint-another-website-scanner"}},"__N_SSG":true}
