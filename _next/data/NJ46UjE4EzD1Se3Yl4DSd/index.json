The extensions adds several new keyboard shortcuts. Some of them use chords including the `CTRL + R` keys. This stopped VS Code from accepting the `CTRL + R` shortcut, because it was waiting for the second part of a chord.\n\nThe authors of the extension (from Microsoft) recognized in hindsight, that [this was a mistake](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/60711) and recommend [in their README](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-npm-scripts) to remap the shortcut for these commands.\n\nNow it is up to you to decide, if it is worth to keep the extension and remap the shortcuts or to remove it altogether.

My NodeList is not an Array","description":"NodeList are like arrays, but the are not arrays. So what to do?","date":"2020-04-04 22:48:00 +0200","slug":"help-my-nodelist-is-not-an-array","content":"\nLet's say that you have to find a list of all links on a page. This is a fairly basic task and can be solved in different ways. For our purposes, using Vanilla JS, we could either use `document.getElementsByTagName` or `document.querySelectorAll`. While the former returns a `HTMLCollection`, the latter returns a `NodeList`. They are similar enough for our example, so we'll go with `querySelectorAll`. Our code will look something like this:\n\n```js\n// let elements = document.getElementsByTagName(\"a\")\n// HTMLCollection(3) [a, a, a]\n\nlet elements = document.querySelectorAll(\"a\")\n// NodeList(3) [a, a, a]\n```\n\nThat looks promising! As a next step, we want to get the `\"href\"` attribute from each link. So that we end up with a list of urls that page links to. Since we are well versed developers and want to use a functional approach, we use the `map` function. As a reminder, the map function will execute the callback for each element in the array and create a new array from the return values. Combined with arrow functions we get some concise, expressive code:\n\n```js\nlet links = elements.map(elem => elem.getAttribute(\"href\"));\n// Uncaught TypeError: document.querySelectorAll(...).map is not a function\n```\n\nHowever, that will result in a nasty TypeError. But why? Both the `NodeList` and the `HtmlCollection` look like arrays and can even access single items with `elements[index]`. As it turns out, there are [iterable objects](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Iteration_protocols) as well as \"array-like objects\". Array-like objects have a `length` property and can access elements via an index, but don't have all the methods, that natural arrays have. Which is precisely the case with `NodeList` and `HtmlCollection`.\n\nThere are two quick and easy solutions (probably more, but those should be sufficient) to solve this problem:\n\n## Array.from\n\n<blockquote class=\"c-quote\" cite=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/from\">\"The Array.from() method creates a new, shallow-copied Array instance from an array-like or iterable object.\"</blockquote>\n\n`\"Array.from\"` is a new built-in function in ES6 (polyfills for IE are available), which can convert the `NodeList` and other objects into actual arrays. With that, we are now able to finally use the map function to implement our logic.\n\n```js\nlet elements = document.querySelectorAll(\"a\");\nlet links = Array.from(elements).map(elem => elem.getAttribute(\"href\"));\n```\n\n## Spread/Rest operator\n\nThe second solution utilizes the new spread and rest operators. By extracting the elements of a `NodeList` and immediately spreading it into a new array.\n\n```js\nlet elements = document.querySelectorAll(\"a\");\nlet links = [...elements].map(elem => elem.getAttribute(\"href\"));\n```\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBoth solutions work fine for that example. The main take away is, that you should be aware that not everything that looks like an array at first glance, really can be used in all situations like an array. However, additions with ES6 like the spread operator make dealing with arrays (and objects) easier and more comfortable.\n\n**Resources**\n* [querySelectorAll MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/querySelectorAll)\n* [NodeList](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/NodeList)\n* [Array.from](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/from)\n* [Spread syntax](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_syntax)","url":"https://www.tompka.io/posts/help-my-nodelist-is-not-an-array"},{"layout":"post","title":"git check-ignore: a helpful utility","description":"Find out who to use the git check-ignore utility","date":"2020-04-01 22:05:00 +0200","slug":"git-check-ignore-a-helpful-utility","content":"\nIf you ever wondered, why you can't add a file to git that you just created, it is probably somewhere ignored in a `.gitignore` file.

While the functionality itself has been around for a while, I am not sure that everyone working with Visual Studio is aware of it. It is possible to inspect the returned value of a method immediately after it has returned.\n\nSuppose you have a method like `Calc` in the following example. The result of the expression on line 10 is immediately returned. However, during debugging, you might want to inspect the return value before it is passed into another method on line 3.\n\n```c#\nstatic void Main(string[] args)\n{\n    SomeOtherCalc(Calc(1, 2));\n    var foo = \"\";\n    // ...\n}\n\nstatic int Calc(int a, int b)\n{\n    return a + b;\n}\n\nstatic void SomeOtherCalc(int c)\n{\n    // ...\n}\n```\n\nTraditionally, you could temporarily introduce a local variable `result`, store the computation and return `result` afterwards. However, that would require you to rebuild the project and introduce temporary unnecessary code.\n\n```\n// Possible, but we try to avoid that\nstatic int Calc(int a, int b)\n{\n    var result = a + b;\n    return result;\n}\n```\n\nInstead, you can add a breakpoint on your expression on line 10. Once hit, you \"Step Out\" of the method. This will place the debugger on the line, where the method has been called (line 3). Exactly at this point, you can now inspect the returned value either via the \"Immediate Window\" by typing `$ReturnValue` or via the \"Autos\" window, where the value will also be displayed.\n\n<figure>\n    <img src=\"/assets/images/returned_value.png\" alt=\"Inspect the returned value with Visual Studio Debugger\">\n    <figcaption class=\"c-caption\">Inspect the returned value with Visual Studio Debugger</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nWith this useful functionality, you can inspect the return values of methods more easily without actually modifying the source code.

Suppose you have a list of players with their name and number of losses. Since it is a legacy implementation, new players \"Losses\" are initialized with `null`.\n\n```c#\nclass Player {\n    public string Name { get; set; }\n    public decimal? Losses { get; set; }\n}\n\nvar allEntries = new List<Player>\n{\n    new Player { Name = \"Player A\", Losses = 5 },\n    new Player { Name = \"Player B\", Losses = 8 },\n    new Player { Name = \"Player C\", Losses = null },\n    new Player { Name = \"Player D\", Losses = 1 },\n    new Player { Name = \"Player F\", Losses = 10 },\n};\n```\n\nWe want to get the top 3 players with the lowest number of losses to reward them. We can easily achieve that by using `OrderBy` and `Take`.\n\n```c#\nvar topEntries = allEntries\n    .OrderBy(e => e.Losses)\n    .Take(3)\n    .ToList();\n```\n\nNormally, we would expect our `topEntries` to contain the Players \"Player D\", \"Player A\" and \"Player B\" with 1, 5 and 8 losses respectively. However, soon we realize, that actually \"Player C\" is the top player with his `Losses = null`. So if you ever have to sort by a nullable property, be sure to remember that `null` values are ordered first by default. In the example, a fix would be trivial by filtering out null values before ordering.\n\n```c#\nvar topEntries = allEntries\n    .Where(e => e.Losses != null)\n    .OrderBy(e => e.Losses)\n    .Take(3)\n    .ToList();\n```\n\n## A deeper dive\n\nHow does that actually work internally? `OrderBy` uses an `IComparer` to compare entries and order them properly. It is possible to specify a custom implementation as the second argument for the `OrderBy` method. If no argument is provided, it will fall back to `Comparer<decimal?>.Default`. Since our type is nullable, this will be a `NullableComparer<decimal?>`. You can checkout the whole logic and implementation [on GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/referencesource/blob/master/mscorlib/system/collections/generic/comparer.cs). The important part is the `Compare` method.\n\n```c#\n// NullableComparer<T> implementation\npublic override int Compare(Nullable<T> x, Nullable<T> y) {\n    if (x.HasValue) {\n        if (y.HasValue) return x.value.CompareTo(y.value);\n        return 1;\n    }\n    if (y.HasValue) return -1;\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nIf you are unsure, what the return values of -1, 0 and +1 mean in that context, you can always refer to [the Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.icomparable?view=netframework-4.8). Basically, if the value is less than zero, \"x\" is ordered first. If the value is greater than zero, \"y\" is ordered first. So if we examine the `NullableComparer<T>::Compare` implementation, we get the following results:\n\n* If \"x\" is **NOT NULL** and \"y\" is **NOT NULL** ➡ The smaller numeric value will be ordered first\n* If \"x\" is **NOT NULL** and \"y\" is **NULL** ➡ \"y\" (null) is ordered first\n* If \"x\" is **NULL** and \"y\" is **NOT NULL** ➡ \"x\" (null) is ordered first\n* If \"x\" is **NULL** and \"y\" is **NULL** ➡ Both are null and don't need to be reordered.\n\nAnd that is the explanation, why `null` values are ordered first.

Creating complex layouts and let content editors modify the layout is even more difficult. Luckily, Umbraco provides a special Property Editor exactly for this use case: [Grid Layout](https://our.umbraco.com/documentation/getting-started/backoffice/property-editors/built-in-property-editors/grid-layout).\n\n## Grid Layout\n\nGrid Layout gives the developers and content editors a lot of flexibility. The developers can configure the basic structure of the layout. They can define layouts for columns and rows as well as useable grid editors. The content editors can then create as many rows/columns as they like (within the predefined structure), and use the available grid editors. They can easily create, edit, order and remove those editors, giving them great flexibility in setting up pages and improving their workflow. While the default implementation of the Grid Layout is based on a Bootstrap grid, all views can easily be changed by developers to accommodate different requirements.\n\nUmbraco ships with a few default grid editors out of the box (see [grid.editors.config.js](https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco-CMS/blob/v8/dev/src/Umbraco.Web.UI.Client/src/config/grid.editors.config.js)). Those include elements like `Headline`, `Image`, `Rich text editor` and some more. With these basic elements you can already cover quite some use cases. However, you might want create more sophisticated components, which consist of multiple different properties. Luckily, this is also possible and that's where [LeBlender](https://our.umbraco.com/packages/backoffice-extensions/leblender/) comes into play.\n\n## LeBlender\n\nWhile it is certainly possible to [create your own custom grid editors from scratch](https://our.umbraco.com/documentation/getting-started/backoffice/property-editors/built-in-property-editors/grid-layout/Build-Your-Own-Editor), it is quite tedious and might take some time to get right. However, the Backoffice extension \"LeBlender\" enables a quick and easy way to configure complex custom grid editors.\n\n<figure>\n    <img src=\"/assets/images/leblender.png\" alt=\"Backoffice view of LeBlender. It allows to create custom grid editors with multiple configurable properties\">\n    <figcaption class=\"c-caption\">Backoffice view of LeBlender. It allows to create custom grid editors with multiple configurable properties</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nWhile the custom grid editors can be configure via the backend, the developers has full control over the view logic of the custom editor. By default, LeBlender creates a razor view file which can be used to customize the rendering. It is also possible to define a Controller which gives you even more flexibility if you use a lot of custom logic inside your grid editor.\n\nSo if you are regularly working with Umbraco and are using Grid Layout (or thinking about using it), definitely check out LeBlender and give it a try. It is quite easy to get started with it and will save you a lot of time in the long run.\n\n**Resources**\n* [LeBlender Umbraco Extension](https://our.umbraco.com/packages/backoffice-extensions/leblender/)\n* ~~Make your Umbraco Grid Layout smarter with LeBlender 1.0.0~~ **Not Available anymore**\n* [Grid Layout documentation](https://our.umbraco.com/documentation/getting-started/backoffice/property-editors/built-in-property-editors/grid-layout)","url":"https://www.tompka.io/posts/easier-grid-editors-with-leblender"},{"layout":"post","title":"Advanced Static Types in TypeScript on egghead.io","description":"Checkout the fantastic course about TypeScript by Marius Schulz","date":"2019-04-12 19:12:00 +0200","slug":"advanced-static-types-in-typescript-on-egghead","content":"\nIf you are working professionally with TypeScript and have access to [egghead.io](https://egghead.io), I strongly recommend you the Course [Advanced Static Types in TypeScript](https://egghead.io/courses/advanced-static-types-in-typescript) by Marius Schulz.

Those tooltips are controlled via JavaScript. They appear if you hover the element with the mouse cursor and vanish as soon as your mouse leaves the element. That might be a bit of a problem, if you want to customize the HTML/CSS of the tooltip and need to inspect the element. Since as soon as you try to inspect it, it is gone.\n\nToday, I will show you two quick and easy ways (they are pretty similar though) to work around this issue.\n\n## Utilizing setTimeout\n\nThe first solution has already been posted on [CSS Tricks as Timed Debugger](https://css-tricks.com/set-timed-debugger-web-inspect-hard-grab-elements/), but it is still worth repeating. What we want to do, is freeze any changes to the DOM, as long as we want to inspect it. You might have noticed it already, that happens when you place `debugger;` somewhere in your JS code or hit a breakpoint.\n\n<blockquote class=\"c-quote\" cite=\"https://css-tricks.com/set-timed-debugger-web-inspect-hard-grab-elements/\">\nA debugger; statement, when the DevTools are open, kinda freezes the DOM. No more events are fired and script excecution is completely paused.\n<small class=\"c-quote__source\">https://css-tricks.com/set-timed-debugger-web-inspect-hard-grab-elements/</small>\n</blockquote>\n\n\nWe just need a way to delay it, so that we have a chance to open the tooltip. Luckily, this is quite easy with `setTimeout`:\n\n```js\n> setTimeout(() => { debugger; }, 3000)\n```\n\nThis way, you have enough time to open the tooltip. As soon as the code executes, the `debugger;` statement is hit.\n\n## Pause script execution\n\nThere is another way to trigger the same behaviour: You can use the shortcut for your dev tools to \"pause script execution\". For Google Chrome this happens to be `F8`. So hover over the desired element to open the tooltip, press `F8` and you are free to inspect the tooltip as you wish.\n\n<figure>\n    <img src=\"/assets/images/pause_script.png\" alt=\"Pause script execution tooltip from Chrome DevTools\">\n    <figcaption class=\"c-caption\">Pause script execution tooltip from Chrome DevTools</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n## Conclusion\n\nSo both tricks work basically the same and are really easy to use. They both utilize the fact, that the DOM is frozen, as long as the JS execution is stopped on a breakpoint. So give it a try!\n\n**Resources**\n* [Bootstrap Tooltips](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/components/tooltips/)\n* [Set a Timed Debugger To Web Inspect Hard-To-Grab Elements](https://css-tricks.com/set-timed-debugger-web-inspect-hard-grab-elements/)","url":"https://www.tompka.io/posts/debug-tooltips"},{"layout":"post","title":"Webhint.io - another website scanner","description":"Keep an eye out on the new website scanner webhint.io","date":"2018-12-03 22:37:00 +0100","slug":"webhint-another-website-scanner","content":"\nThere are quite a lot of different tools and scanners out there for us web developers, to monitor best practices on our websites.

Some charts are reused multiple times across the website, so we decided to prerender them via [highcharts/node-export-server](https://github.com/highcharts/node-export-server). Due to operational reasons, it is hosted inside a Windows Service via [Azure/iisnode](https://github.com/Azure/iisnode). This process works reasonably well. However, we noticed, that there are errors logged, although the charts seem to be rendered just fine:\n\n```\n[error] phantom worker 2 error - SetProcessDpiAwareness failed: \"COM error 0x80070005  (Unknown error 0x0ffffffff80070005)\"\n```\n\n## Investigation of the Error\n\nNaturally, we wanted to find the cause of this error, if there are some issues we should be aware of and if there is anything we could do to avoid it.\n\nA quick search reveals, that there are quite some GitHub repositories, that experience similar issues. In the end, most of them refer to an issue in PhantomJS. The most prominent discussion is in the [issue #14095](https://github.com/ariya/phantomjs/issues/14095). If you don't know: \"PhantomJS (phantomjs.org) is a headless WebKit scriptable with JavaScript.\" (from Phantom JS README). Incidentally, it is used by the Highcharts Node.js Export Server to render the charts. And unfortunately, this issue occurs, if PhantomJS is run from a service in Windows. Which happens to be just what we are doing.\n\n## Resolving the Error\n\n### Pass flag to PhantomJS\n\nHowever, there seems to be a way around this issue. According the issue, it is possible to pass `-platform windows:dpiawareness=0` to PhantomJS. So can we actually configure this, since the phantomjs process is spawned by the node-export-server? The actual call happens in `phantompool.js`:\n\n```js\n// https://github.com/highcharts/node-export-server/blob/2.0.16/lib/phantompool.js\nworker.process = phantomjs.exec(settings.worker, (__dirname + '/../'));\n```\n\nThere is no way to configure additional options, so we are out of luck here.\n\n### Windows Registry\n\nThere seems to be some additional way to work around this issue via the Windows Registry or Windows Policies, but I wasn't able to find out the specifics. If you have more luck on this front, please let me know.\n\n### Fork node-export-server\n\nAnother possibility would be to fork the node-export-server repository on GitHub and implement the desired functionality. However, this would cause additional overhead and it seems unlikely, that this would be merged back into the main repository. Since it seems that the engineers from Highcharts are thinking about moving to a different headless browser like Chrome (with its rather new headless mode). However, there doesn't seem to be a clear path or timeline yet. Follow the [issue #57 on GitHub](https://github.com/highcharts/node-export-server/issues/57) for further updates.\n\n## Result\n\nIn the end, we decided to live with these errors for now, as there doesn't seem to be any problem with the chart generation itself. Workarounds would require further development and testing resources which are currently not available.\n\n**Resources**\n* [node-export-server Repository](https://github.com/highcharts/node-export-server)\n* [iisnode Repository](https://github.com/Azure/iisnode)\n* [PhantomJS Repository](https://github.com/ariya/phantomjs)\n","url":"https://www.tompka.io/posts/com-exception-with-iisnode-and-node-export-server"},{"layout":"post","title":"Umbraco: Layers of Caching","description":"How to make sense of caching in Umbraco","date":"2018-11-21 20:00:00 +0100","slug":"umbraco-layers-of-caching","content":"\n[Umbraco](https://umbraco.com/products/umbraco-cms/) is a widely used ASP.NET CMS. If you worked with Umbraco for some time, you might have noticed, that there are various layers of caching and it can be confusing where data is stored.\n\nSo Umbraco has four layers, where data is stored or cached:\n1. Database table `[dbo].[cmsPropertyData]`\n2. Database table `[dbo].[cmsContentXml]`\n3. XML file `App_Data/umbraco.config`\n4. In-Memory cache\n\n\n\n## cmsPropertyData\n\nThe `[dbo].[cmsPropertyData]` table resides in the umbraco database. It holds all data stored in the properties of all your nodes. Take note, that all previous versions are stored as well. So if you change something in the backend, it will be reflected in this table. However, this table is not actually used for the frontend. You want to take a look at `[dbo].[cmsContentXml]` for that.\n\n## cmsContentXml\n\nOnce you publish a node, Umbraco gathers all the information for this node, and stores it as a XML structure in the `[dbo].[cmsContentXml]` table. So you will have on entry per node with its node id and all of its data. This might be the source for the data in your application, but it also might be the `umbraco.config`.\n\n## umbraco.config\n\nThe `umbraco.config` is basically the same as the `[dbo].[cmsContentXml]` but stored as a file on disk. By default, this file is created and used to reduce the load on the database. However, this can be disabled via a `Web.config` entry.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nSo this was a short introduction of the different layers of Umbraco. You might not encounter it in your day to day work, but if you need to change something directly in the database, it might be good to have an idea where the data might be cached.\n\n**Resources**\n* [Umbraco CMS](https://umbraco.com/products/umbraco-cms/)\n* [Umbraco CMS - GitHub Repository](https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco-CMS)","url":"https://www.tompka.io/posts/umbraco-layers-of-caching"},{"layout":"post","title":"Find elements by css properties","description":"How to find all elements with a specific css property","date":"2018-09-28 20:01:00 +0200","slug":"find-elements-by-css-property","content":"\nToday it like to share short [code snippet](https://gist.github.com/zlypher/0b9b295e2ee39da4125105e88d8d7d3e) with you. You can use it to find all elements with a specific css property value. In my example, I want to find all elements with a custom `z-index`. So let's jump right in. The snippet is pretty straight forward:\n\n```js\n(() => {\n    const elems = Array.from(document.querySelectorAll(\"*\"))\n        .filter(elem => window.getComputedStyle(elem).zIndex !== \"auto\")\n        .map(elem => {\n            return {\n                elem: elem,\n                style: window.getComputedStyle(elem),\n            };\n        });\n    console.table(elems);\n})();\n```\n\n## Explanation\n\nIn the gist, you will find another variations with slightly different tradeoffs. For sake of brevity, we will only consider this one. So let's step through it.\n\nWe create a new function with the nifty arrow syntax. This could easily be written as `(function() {` for older browser though.\n\n```js\n(() => {\n```\n\nNext up we query all elements which match the `*` selector (hint: all of them). And create an array from the returned `NodeList`.\n\n```js\n    const elems = Array.from(document.querySelectorAll(\"*\"))\n```\n\nHere comes the actual fun part. With `window.getComputedStyle(elem)`, the browser provides an interface to fetch all css declarations which are applied to the element (including user agent stylesheets, so don't wonder, why there are way more values than you expected). We can now access all css properties in three different ways (see below). With `.zIndex`, we fetch the declartion for the `z-index` and check if it is not set to `auto`. `auto` is the default value from the HTML specification and applied by the browser, so we want to filter all those elements out, where it is still the browser default value.\n\n```js\n        .filter(elem => window.getComputedStyle(elem).zIndex !== \"auto\")\n```\n\nNow we map over all found elements and create a new object with a reference to the element as well as the style declaration for each element.\n\n```js\n        .map(elem => {\n            return {\n                elem: elem,\n                style: window.getComputedStyle(elem),\n            };\n        });\n```\n\nAt last, we can output our results or continue working with them.\n\n```js\n    console.table(elems);\n```\n\nAnd finally end the function and call it, to make it an IIFE (immediately invoked function espression).\n\n```js\n})();\n```\n\n## Output\n\nIf you run this snippet in the console on [https://github.com](https://github.com) for example, you will receive an output like that:\n\n<figure>\n    <img src=\"/assets/images/elems_by_css.png\" alt=\"Example output from the console from the snippet, from github.com\">\n    <figcaption class=\"c-caption\">Example output from the console from the snippet, from github.com</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n## window.getComputedStyle\n\nThe function `window.getComputedStyle(elem)` returns a `CSSStyleDeclaration`, but how can you actually extract the css property values? There are actually three different ways to do that:\n\n* via a function `getPropertyValue(propName)`\n* via index access `cs[propName]`\n* via property `cs.propName`\n\n<blockquote class=\"c-quote\" cite=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/getComputedStyle\">\"The CSS property values may be accessed using the getPropertyValue(propName) API or by indexing directly into the object such as cs['z-index'] or cs.zIndex.\"</blockquote>\n\n**Resources**\n* [Window/getComputedStyle on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/getComputedStyle)\n* [CSSStyleDeclaration on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CSSStyleDeclaration)\n* [Gist with Code Example](https://gist.github.com/zlypher/0b9b295e2ee39da4125105e88d8d7d3e)","url":"https://www.tompka.io/posts/find-elements-by-css-property"},{"layout":"post","title":"Automatically add attributes for external links with Jekyll","description":"Use jekyll-extlinks to automatically add attributes for external links with Jekyll","date":"2018-09-21 23:14:00 +0200","slug":"attributes-for-external-links-with-jekyll","content":"\nSome time ago, I wrote that one should add `rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"` to external links.

But where to start? Luckily, each page has a big edit button at the top and works just like most other wikis. However, before you can edit a page, you need to sign in to your MDN profile. If you don't have one, you can sign in with GitHub and a MDN profile will automatically be created.\n\nAfter signing in and editing a page, you will see a huge RichText editor. The browser compatibility table is normally at the very bottom, but when you scroll there you will find a message along those lines:\n\n<img src=\"/assets/images/mdn_edit_compatibility.png\" alt=\"Note on Edit for the compatibility table\">\n\nSo the browser compatibility data is actually managed in a separate [git repository on GitHub](https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data). So let's head over to GitHub and check it out. The repository is quite nicely structured and really well documented. The [README.md](https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data/blob/master/README.md) describes the structure of the repository and the CONTRIBUTING.md explains what you should be aware of if you want to contribute.\n\nSo I quickly browser through the open Pull Requests, but I didn't find anything for my specific issue. Great! So let's find out where we can make the necessary changes. And sure enough, we find the file `/html/elements/input/color.json` which contains the exact data we want to modify.\n\nThe JSON structure is pretty straight forward. It contains an entry for each browser:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"support\": {\n        \"chrome\": {\n            \"version_added\": \"20\"\n        },\n        \"chrome_android\": {\n            \"version_added\": null\n        },\n        \"edge\": {\n            \"version_added\": null\n        },\n        \"edge_mobile\": {\n            \"version_added\": null\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe `version_added` property can have four different states:\n* **string**: The exact version when a browser started supporting the element/attribute\n* **null**: The compatibility is unknown\n* **true**: The browser supports it, but the exact version is unknown\n* **false**: The browser doesn't support it\n\nOkay so what shall we enter? `true`? That would be possible, but it would be neat if we know the actual version. Well, [caniuse.com](https://caniuse.com/#feat=input-color) thinks that it is supported since version 14 and sure enough, we find a Microsoft support ticket (wpdev.uservoice.com/forums/257854-microsoft-edge-developer/suggestions/6514216--input-type-color **Not Available anymore**) with an official response stating that it is indeed shipped since EdgeHTML 14.\n\nSo what is there left to do? We simply fork the repository, edit the `color.json` file and enter `\"14\"` as the `version_added` for `edge` and `edge_mobile` and create the pull request. To ease the pain for the reviewers, we provide the link to the microsoft support ticket.\n\nAnd voilà, we are finished. And not even 24 hours later, the pull request was successfully merged without any problems!\n\nSo it is actually quite easy to contribute to most of the online developer resources these days. If you haven't tried it, I encourage you to take a look. Small patches and updates like this make the resource a little bit better and more valuable step by step!\n\nRead up on this topic:\n\n* [MDN web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web)\n* [MDN web docs contribution guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/MDN/Contribute)\n* [MDN browser compatibility repository](https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data)\n* [My first PR to the compatibility repository](https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data/pull/2434)","url":"https://www.tompka.io/posts/first-contribution-to-mdn"},{"layout":"post","title":"Easier Web Development with Emmet","description":"Emmet — the essential toolkit for web-developers","date":"2018-06-15 21:58:00 +0100","slug":"easier-web-development-with-emmet","content":"\nIf you are a web developer or often find yourself writing lots of HTML, XML, JSX and CSS, then this post is for you! Today I'd like to introduce you to a very useful tool for writing lot's of boilerplate HTML: [Emmet](https://emmet.io/)\n\nProbably almost everyone feels the same way... writing lots of HTML or CSS is rather boring, repetetive and error prone. Some editors automatically close html tags, but that's mostly it. This is where Emmet comes into play. It defines a css like syntax which expands to actual valid HTML structure or CSS properties.\n\nSo let's not waste any time and give you an example. The following abbreviation demonstrates the basic features of Emmet.\n\n```text\nsection>.hello>p{World}\n```\n\nThis snippet will expand to the following HTML structure:\n\n```html\n<section>\n    <div class=\"hello\">\n        <p>World</p>\n    </div>\n</section>\n```\n\nPretty neat, huh? If you have ever written some css, the snippet should be pretty self explanatory. You can create children with `>`, names prefixed with a `.` will add a class to the element and `{}` let's you specify some actual text content. Everything that is not recognized as a special snippet will be rendered as a tag name. Check out the [Emmet Cheat Sheet](https://docs.emmet.io/cheat-sheet/) for lot's of different possibilites to use and combine different snippets!\n\nOne more neat trick combines multiplication with item numbering. So if you want to create a list with 5 elements, numbered from 1 to 5, this would be trivial with emmet:\n\n```text\nul>li*5{$}\n```\n\nAnd zack, it will output:\n\n```html\n<ul>\n    <li>1</li>\n    <li>2</li>\n    <li>3</li>\n    <li>4</li>\n    <li>5</li>\n</ul>\n```\n\nThat is so sweet and will reduce the time to write stuff like that quite a bit! And another great thing: Emmet works for JSX as well! So don't worry about the `class` attributes. If you are inside a JSX context, Emmet will automatically create `className` isntead. Oh, and there is also a resolver for CSS snippets. So you can quickly specify properties without having to type out the whole line. See some nifty examples below:\n\n```css\n.test {\n    /* pos:r */\n    position: relative;\n    /* d:f */\n    display: flex;\n    /* pt40px */\n    padding-top: 40px;\n    /* ml2e */\n    margin-left: 2em;\n}\n\n/* @m */\n@media screen {\n    \n}\n```\n\nThere are tons of different options for almost all css properties available (even helpers to automatically create browser prefixes). So definitely checkout the docs from emmet, which are really comprehensive.\n\nIf you are wondering how to actually use it, don't worry... most of the modern text editors and IDEs have extensions for Emmet readily available or even built in (VSCode!). [Browse through the download section of Emmet](https://emmet.io/download/), if you are not sure about your editor. Even online services like CodePen or JSFiddle support emmet abbrviations out of the box.\n\nIt might take a bit to get used to it, but it will definitely speed up your development process in the long run. Give it a try and spread the word if you found it useful!\n\nCheck out Emmet here:\n* [Emmet Website](https://emmet.io/)\n* [Emmet GitHub](https://github.com/emmetio)\n* [Emmet Cheat Sheet](https://docs.emmet.io/cheat-sheet/)","url":"https://www.tompka.io/posts/easier-web-development-with-emmet"},{"layout":"post","title":"Git Merge Conflicts","description":"What are git merge conflicts","date":"2018-05-22 21:29:00 +0100","slug":"git-merge-conflicts","content":"\nToday I came across a question regarding merge conflicts with git from a teammate:\n\n\"Can I use Visual Studio to resolve merge conflicts or is it required to use a merge tool?\"\n\nAt first I was surprised by this question but then I realized, that git merge conflicts might be a black box for some developers. So what exactly are merge conflicts?\n\nNormally git is pretty good in merging changes from different branches, since these changes are often in different files. However, if two or more people try to merge changens to the same lines, merge conflicts are likely to occur. In these circumstances, git is not able to automatically determine which changes should end up in the merged version.\n\nTo resolve this issue, manual intervention is needed. To make it easy for developers to see, what has been changed, git adds conflict markers to the file.\n\n```\nQ: What shall I do in case of a merge conflict?\n<<<<<<< HEAD\nA: Panic!\n=======\nB: Stay calm!\n>>>>>>> other-branch\n```\n\nSo what is there left to do in case of a merge conflict? You need to remove the unwanted change and delete the conflicts markers. So that only the code/text is left that you actually want. Commit and you are done.\n\nAnd what is the difference to visual merge tools? Basically there is none. They only thing these tools offer is the \"visual\" part. The highlight the changes from the different branches a bit nicer - often side by side - than an ordinary text editor. However, modern text editors like Atom or [Visual Code normally provide pretty good help with merging](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/versioncontrol#_merge-conflicts) as well.\n\nSo the next time you encounter a merge conflict, don't fret! Remember that merge conflicts can - in most cases easily - be resolved by opening the file in an text editor and removing the unwanted text as well as the conflict markers.\n\nGitHub has pretty good articles on dealing with [merge conflicts](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/addressing-merge-conflicts/about-merge-conflicts) and [resolving merge conflicts](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/addressing-merge-conflicts/resolving-a-merge-conflict-using-the-command-line), so be sure to check them out.","url":"https://www.tompka.io/posts/git-merge-conflicts"},{"layout":"post","title":"MSBuild Basics","description":"Find out what msbuild is and what the stuff in a csproj file really means","date":"2018-03-05 18:30:00 +0200","slug":"msbuild-basics","content":"\nEver wondered what stands behind Visual Studio that creates the actual application from your source files?

You want to restart it, but you discover, that it is stuck in either the state \"Starting\" or \"Stopping\". Unfortunately, all options are greyed out and you can neither start nor stop the service via the GUI.\n\nSo how can we resolve this issue and get the service back up and running? Fortunately, there is a solution which has been found long ago (see further links) and is not that hard to execute. All you need to do is find the process id (PID) of the offending service and kill it via the command line.\n\nFind out the PID of the service.

Make sure you have sufficient privileges to kill the service.\n\n```bash\n> taskkill /f /pid 3976\nSUCESS: The process with PID 3976 has been terminated.\n```\n\nThis will kill the service completely and you should be able to restart it again.\n\nRead up on this topic:\n* [How to recover from Windows service that is stuck in starting or stopped state](https://www.schneider-electric.com/en/faqs/FA239679/)\n* How to kill a windows service stuck on stopping or starting (support.minisoft.com/index.php/how-to-kill-a-windows-service-stuck-on-stopping-or-starting/ **Not Available anymore**)","url":"https://www.tompka.io/posts/windows-service-stuck-in-status-starting"},{"layout":"post","title":"Social Share Links","date":"2018-01-15 15:32:00 +0200","slug":"social-share-links","content":"\n## The Problem\n\nQuite a few pages need social share links nowadays. Product pages, blog posts, news articles, ... They are basically everywhere. There are quite a lot of libraries and plugins available which provide the desired functionality. However, they often rely on additional JavaScript being loaded and come with a lot of unnecessary stuff.\n\nBut don't forget! Most of them are ordinary links, which don't require anything except a link tag. So how can you add the most common social share links to your page?\n\n## Social Links\n\n**Facebook**\n\nFacebook is probably one of the most popular social networks. Unfortunately, you can only share a URL, but you can't prefill the text to comment. Therefore, the share link is rather straight forward:\n\n`https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=[SHARE URL]`\n\nJust remember, that `[SHARE URL]` has to be a valid URL, or the link won't work.\n\n**Twitter**\n\nNext on the list is twitter. By specifying the `[SHARE TEXT]` it is possible the prefill the tweet with any textual content you like:\n\n`https://twitter.com/intent/tweet/?text=[SHARE TEXT]`\n`https://twitter.com/home?status=[SHARE TEXT]` (works as well)\n\n**Whats App**\n\nTo enable sharing via WhatsApp, one can use the following link. For WhatsApp it is possible to specify content, which will be prefilled. If the user has WhatsApp installed, this link will open the App and ask to select a contact to send the message to.\n\n`whatsapp://send?text=[SHARE TEXT]`\n\nThis share link only makes sense on mobile (maybe tablet as well) devices. So be sure to include appropriate checks, or your users might get confused.\n\n**E-Mail**\n\nE-Mail is the next one on the list. Old, but still used to share links and information. Just as you might have imagined, you can specify a receiver email adress, a subject and the content of the email:\n\n`mailto:[TO EMAIL]?subject=[SHARE TITLE]&body=[SHARE TEXT]`\n\nThe `[TO EMAIL]` part is completely optional. If it is not specified, the email agent will prepare the email with the given subject and body.\n\n**SMS**\n\nSMS share links are a bit special. Different behaviour on Android and iOS. You don't actually have to set a [PHONE NUMBER]. If you leave it blank the user will be able to select a recipient. The message will be prefilled with the given text.\n\n`sms:[PHONE NUMBER]?body=[SHARE TEXT]`\n\n*(This link will only work on Android though. See Update for further details)*\n\n## Others\n\nThere are a lot of other social networks and ways to share content. But don't worry, there are a lot of resources available online, where you can [generate social](http://www.sharelinkgenerator.com/) [share links](https://sharingbuttons.io/) or check the [share urls](https://github.com/bradvin/social-share-urls).\n\n## Conclusion\n\nTo sum up, it is very easy to get started and integrate social share links into your website.\n\n<section class=\"c-mind\" markdown=\"1\">\n**Keep in Mind:** Don't forget to URL encode the text content you want to share with these links.\n</section>\n\n\nRead up on this topic:\n* [StackOverflow answer regarding SMS share link](https://stackoverflow.com/a/19126326/733368)\n\n<section class=\"c-update\" markdown=\"1\">\n**Update 2018-01-18:**\n\nIt appears, that iOS handles the SMS share links differently than Android. Android accepts a link format like `sms:[PHONE NO]?body=[TEXT CONTENT]`. However, this will fail on iOS. Instead you have to use `sms:[PHONE NO];body=[TEXT CONTENT]` for old iOS versions and `sms:[PHONE NO]&body=[TEXT CONTENT]` for iOS 8 and above. Take note of the delimiter in front of the body parameter!\n\nCheck out [How to pre-populate the sms body text via an html link](https://stackoverflow.com/q/6480462/733368) via StackOverflow.\n</section>","url":"https://www.tompka.io/posts/social-share-links"},{"layout":"post","title":"Go - Create GitHub Releases with GoReleaser","description":"Easily create GitHub Releases with GoReleaser","date":"2017-12-13 22:45:00 +0200","slug":"golang-github-release-with-goreleaser","content":"\nSo you just finished your neat little go project and want to distribute it via [Github Releases](https://help.github.com/articles/about-releases/).

If you installed the \"gh-pages\" packages and added the required script to package.json you only need to execute the deploy script and you are good to go.\n\n## The Problem\n\nBut this time, I ran into a rather strange problem:\n\n```bash\nλ npm run deploy                                                                                                                   \n                                                                                                                                   \n> bool@1.0.0 predeploy E:\\projects\\bool                                                                                            \n> npm run build                                                                                                                    \n                                                                                                                                   \n                                                                                                                                   \n> bool@1.0.0 build E:\\projects\\bool                                                                                                \n> react-scripts build                                                                                                              \n                                                                                                                                   \nCreating an optimized production build...                                                                                          \nCompiled successfully.                                                                                                             \n                                                                                                                                   \nFile sizes after gzip:                                                                                                             \n                                                                                                                                   \n  50.73 KB  build\\static\\js\\main.54678454.js                                                                                       \n  658 B     build\\static\\css\\main.5c98f198.css                                                                                     \n                                                                                                                                   \nThe project was built assuming it is hosted at /bool/.                                                                             \nYou can control this with the homepage field in your package.json.                                                                 \n                                                                                                                                   \nThe build folder is ready to be deployed.                                                                                          \nTo publish it at https://zlypher.github.io/bool, run:                                                                              \n                                                                                                                                   \n  npm run deploy                                                                                                                   \n                                                                                                                                   \n                                                                                                                                   \n> bool@1.0.0 deploy E:\\projects\\bool                                                                                               \n> gh-pages -d build                                                                                                                \n                                                                                                                                   \nerror: unable to create file deployed at Mon Sep 25 18:25:02 UTC 2017 by Deployment Bot (from Travis CI): Invalid argument         \nfatal: Could not reset index file to revision 'origin/gh-pages'.                                                                   \n                                                                                                                                   \nnpm ERR! code ELIFECYCLE                                                                                                           \nnpm ERR! errno 1                                                                                                                   \nnpm ERR! bool@1.0.0 deploy: `gh-pages -d build`npm ERR!

Even \"git checkout gh-pages\" fails with the same error.\n\nNow if you've already used Travis CI to deploy th GH pages, you will be aware, that it creates a file with the timestamp of the deployment. In this example this files is conveniently named \"Mon Sep 25 18:25:02 UTC 2017 by Deployment Bot (from Travis CI)\".\n\n## The Solution\n\nAs it turns out, Windows really dislikes colons (\":\") in file names and prohibits them. So git can't create the file during checkout of the branch and fails with an \"Invalid argument\". In my case, manually deleting the file via github.com resolved the issue. Afterwards, the deployment script completed successfully.","url":"https://www.tompka.io/posts/filename-git-on-windows"},{"layout":"post","title":"Linear Gradient - differences in Chrome/Safari","description":"Browser differences: Linear Gradient","date":"2017-08-16 16:43:20 +0100","categories":"Web","slug":"linear-gradient-differences","content":"\nDifferent browsers (or layout engines) often behave slightly different. One of those differences caught me off guard recently. The culprit: linear-gradient. To be more precise a fade effect from transparent to white.\n\nImage you have a box with text of fixed height and you wan't to fade out the text. A simple implementation would look something like this:\n\n```html\n<div class=\"box\">\n  <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consetetur sadipscing elitr, sed diam nonumy eirmod tempor invidunt ut labore et dolore magna aliquyam erat, sed diam voluptua. At vero eos et accusam et justo duo dolores et ea rebum. Stet clita kasd gubergren, no sea takimata sanctus est Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consetetur sadipscing elitr, sed diam nonumy eirmod tempor invidunt ut labore et dolore magna aliquyam erat, sed diam voluptua. At vero eos et accusam et justo duo dolores et ea rebum.</p>\n  <div class=\"fade\"></div>\n</div>\n```\n\nWith the following styling:\n\n```css\n.container {\n  position: relative;\n  margin: 0 10px;\n  border: 1px solid grey;\n  padding: 8px;\n  width: 300px;\n}\n\n.fade {\n  position: absolute;\n  left: 0;\n  right: 0;\n  bottom: 0;\n  height: 100px;\n  background: linear-gradient(to bottom, rgba(0, 0, 0, 0), white 75%);\n}\n```\n\nSo nothing fancy here. Basically an overlay with a height of 100px and fading from transparent to white. Works in Chrome? Yes, so we are good to go... Actually not quite.\n\n## The Problem\n\nAs you may have noticed, we used `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)` for our transparent color. So a nice pure black with an alpha channel of 0. Turns out, Safari is pretty strict here and draws a strange looking grey gradient.\n\n## The Solution\n\nSo what can we do about this? Luckily, it is sufficient to change the transparent color from a transparent black `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)` to a transparent white `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0)`. With this simple fix everything looks as expected in Safari as well.\n\n[Checkout the Codepen!](https://codepen.io/zlypher/pen/BwRyMb)\n\nTip: If you want to prevent the fade effect to interfere with your text selection, add `pointer-events: none` to `.fade`.","url":"https://www.tompka.io/posts/linear-gradient-differences"},{"layout":"post","title":"Getting Started With SVG Sprites","description":"Getting started with SVG sprites","date":"2017-07-23 19:30:00 +0100","categories":"SVG Web Getting_Started","slug":"getting-started-with-svg-sprites","content":"\nModern websites have a lot of icons scattered around. A solid technique to implement those icons are SVG sprites. As it turns out, it's pretty easy to start using them. If you can't or don't want to use SVGs, an alternative are icon fonts like [Glyphicons from Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/components/#glyphicons) or [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/).\n\nThere are already a lot of solid and good guides in mastering SVG sprites, so this post will focus on the bare essentials to get started. If you are in a hurry, you can skipt straight to the [results](#result).\n\n## Steps\n\n1. Add a new svg element at the top of your body tag. (It might work, if it is placed somewhere else, but to make sure that everything works correctly, place it at the top).\n\n    ```html\n    <body>\n        <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">\n            <!-- Symbols will go here -->\n        </svg>\n    </body>\n    ```\n\n    You will notice, that the svg will probably have a default size. Chromem 59 displays the svg element as rectangle with a width of 300px and a height of 150px. Since we don't need to display the spritesheet itself, we can simply set `display: none`.\n\n    ```html\n    <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" style=\"display: none\">\n    ```\n\n    Note: If you dislike inline styles, you can define a css class and set the display property there. Just make sure, that the svg doesn't show up.\n\n2. Get the actual svg icon from your designer or from the web. There are a lot of websites out there which offer free (always check the license though) svg icons. For this example, let's export an icon from [icomoon](https://icomoon.io/app/). It will look something like this:\n\n    ```html\n    <symbol id=\"icon-html-five\" viewBox=\"0 0 32 32\">\n        <title>html-five</title>\n        <path d=\"M1.892 0l2.567 28.801 11.524 3.199 11.554-3.204 2.572-28.796h-28.216zM25.336 26.963l-9.288 2.574v0.015l-0.024-0.007-0.024 0.007v-0.015l-9.288-2.574-2.195-24.609h23.015l-2.195 24.609zM20.336 16.569l-0.408 4.58-3.944 1.065-3.933-1.060-0.252-2.82h-3.547l0.495 5.547 7.252 2.006 7.229-2.006 0.97-10.844h-12.874l-0.322-3.617h13.517l0.316-3.532h-17.694l0.953 10.681z\"></path>\n    </symbol>\n    ```\n\n    We can almost use this 1:1. Just make sure to save some precious bytes by dropping the `<title>` element.\n\n3. Add the svg icon to your svg spritesheet, by placing the `<symbol>` inside the `<svg>`. Your spritesheet should look something like this\n\n    ```html\n    <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" style=\"display: none\">\n        <symbol id=\"icon-html-five\" viewBox=\"0 0 32 32\">\n            <path d=\"M1.892 0l2.567 28.801 11.524 3.199 11.554-3.204 2.572-28.796h-28.216zM25.336 26.963l-9.288 2.574v0.015l-0.024-0.007-0.024 0.007v-0.015l-9.288-2.574-2.195-24.609h23.015l-2.195 24.609zM20.336 16.569l-0.408 4.58-3.944 1.065-3.933-1.060-0.252-2.82h-3.547l0.495 5.547 7.252 2.006 7.229-2.006 0.97-10.844h-12.874l-0.322-3.617h13.517l0.316-3.532h-17.694l0.953 10.681z\"></path>\n        </symbol>\n    </svg>\n    ```\n\n4. Done! Well almost... Your spritesheet is finished, but you can't see your icon yet. What's left is, to display it somewhere on your page. This is done via this neat little snippet:\n\n    ```html\n    <svg><use xlink:href=\"#icon-html-five\" /></svg>\n    ```\n\n    And voilà... you should see your beautiful icon on your page. Now don't forget to add a width, height and some styling to your new and shiny icon. Oh, and if you have the same icons multiple times on your page, you can style them individually. \n\n## Result\n\nSo all in all your code can look something like the following snippet. Or you can view and edit [an example here](https://codepen.io/zlypher/pen/wqzMKE).\n\n```html\n<body>\n    <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" style=\"display: none;\">\n        <symbol id=\"icon-html-five\" viewBox=\"0 0 32 32\">\n            <path d=\"M1.892 0l2.567 28.801 11.524 3.199 11.554-3.204 2.572-28.796h-28.216zM25.336 26.963l-9.288 2.574v0.015l-0.024-0.007-0.024 0.007v-0.015l-9.288-2.574-2.195-24.609h23.015l-2.195 24.609zM20.336 16.569l-0.408 4.58-3.944 1.065-3.933-1.060-0.252-2.82h-3.547l0.495 5.547 7.252 2.006 7.229-2.006 0.97-10.844h-12.874l-0.322-3.617h13.517l0.316-3.532h-17.694l0.953 10.681z\"></path>\n        </symbol>\n    </svg>\n\n    <div>\n        Here comes my shiny icon:\n        <svg width=\"16px\" height=\"16px\">\n            <use xlink:href=\"#icon-html-five\" />\n        </svg>\n    </div>\n</body>\n```\n\n## Further Links\n\nIf you want to dive deeper into the topic I suggest to scan and read through the following links and experiment with SVGs yourself.\n\n* [An Overview of SVG Sprite Creation Techniques](https://24ways.org/2014/an-overview-of-svg-sprite-creation-techniques/)\n* [How to Implement Cross-Browser SVG Sprites](https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/how-to-implement-cross-browser-svg-sprites--cms-22427)\n* [How to Create and Manage SVG Sprites](https://www.webdesignerdepot.com/2017/05/how-to-create-and-manage-svg-sprites/)\n* [Icon System with SVG Sprites](https://css-tricks.com/svg-sprites-use-better-icon-fonts/)\n* [SVG \"symbol\" a Good Choice for Icons](https://css-tricks.com/svg-symbol-good-choice-icons/)\n\n## Things to keep in mind\n\n* Positive: No additional roundtrip to fetch the icon image from the server\n* Positive: Using the same icon multiple times is cost effective (space)\n* Only add the icons you intend to use on the current site\n* Negative: Additional code which won't be cached\n","url":"https://www.tompka.io/posts/getting-started-with-svg-sprites"},{"layout":"post","title":"Not another developer blog","description":"Welcome to my awesome super unique developer blog","date":"2017-07-14 10:14:22 +0200","categories":"Misc","slug":"not-another-developer-blog","content":"\nThere are a lot of Software Engineer, Software Architect and general Software enthusiast blogs on the web. So why do we need another one (_Hint: this one_)?\n\nWell to be completely honest, there are two reasons behind this blog:\n\n1. If you browse around the web und look for hints, what a successfull Software Engineer should do, you find (among others) the following statements: _\"Build an online presence\"_, _\"Give back to the community, by helping others\"_ or _\"Get a reputation by presenting your skills\"_. Therefore, I aim to fulfill these requirements by writing this blog.\n\n2. I am quite forgetful about some techniques or problems I encounter and solve during my day to day work. So this website doubles as some kind of diary or writeup, so that I can reflect on what I have learned so far and get feedback from everyone else.\n\nI am happy, that you took some time to read one or more pages of this blog and I gladly hear your opinion and I encourage you to give me feedback.","url":"https://www.tompka.io/posts/not-another-developer-blog"}]},"__N_SSG":true}
