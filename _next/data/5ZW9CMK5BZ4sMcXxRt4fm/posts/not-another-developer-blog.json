So why do we need another one (<em>Hint: this one</em>)?</p>\n<p>Well to be completely honest, there are two reasons behind this blog:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>If you browse around the web und look for hints, what a successfull Software Engineer should do, you find (among others) the following statements: <em>\"Build an online presence\"</em>, <em>\"Give back to the community, by helping others\"</em> or <em>\"Get a reputation by presenting your skills\"</em>. Therefore, I aim to fulfill these requirements by writing this blog.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>I am quite forgetful about some techniques or problems I encounter and solve during my day to day work. So this website doubles as some kind of diary or writeup, so that I can reflect on what I have learned so far and get feedback from everyone else.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I am happy, that you took some time to read one or more pages of this blog and I gladly hear your opinion and I encourage you to give me feedback.</p>\n","url":"https://zlypher.github.io/posts/not-another-developer-blog"}},"__N_SSG":true}
