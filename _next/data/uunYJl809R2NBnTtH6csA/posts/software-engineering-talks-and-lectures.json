Now the main problem lies in the discovery of the most interesting ones. There are literally hundreds of videos available via YouTube and other platforms.</p>\n<p>So I made a resolution for 2019 to watch at least 1 hour worth of talks each week. The most interesting ones, which inspired me or taught me something new, will be collected in a curated playlist on YouTube as well as on my blog. So stay tuned for some awesome software engineering talks! You can find most of the list, with a short description of each video, on the new <a href=\"/talks\">\"Talks\" page</a> or you can checkout the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLl0AtsmuedN4lbpkR8lg1hyE-ZCrh9ebd\">YouTube playlist \"Software Engineering Talks and Lectures\"</a>.</p>\n<p>Do you have some favourite talks? Send me a suggestion and I'll be happy to check it out!</p>\n","url":"https://zlypher.github.io/posts/software-engineering-talks-and-lectures"}},"__N_SSG":true}
