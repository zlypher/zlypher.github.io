Another one of those scanners - and pretty new at that - is <a href=\"https://webhint.io\">webhint.io</a>. It features an online scanner as well as a cli tool (neatly packaged via npm) which you can run locally or on your build servers.</p>\n<p>Currently, it tests for various issues in the categories:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Accessibility</li>\n<li>Interoperability</li>\n<li>PWA</li>\n<li>Performance</li>\n<li>Security</li>\n</ul>\n<p>But will it kill/replace Lighthouse and similar tools? Frankly, I don't know and I am not 100% convinced about it yet either. But it definitely looks promising, so keep an eye on it!</p>\n<p><strong>Resources</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://webhint.io\">webhint.io</a></li>\n</ul>\n","url":"https://zlypher.github.io/posts/webhint-another-website-scanner"}},"__N_SSG":true}
