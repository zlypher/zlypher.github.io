{"pageProps":{"post":{"layout":"post","title":"My first contribution to MDN","description":"Follow the journey to my first contribution to MDN","date":"2018-07-09 19:30:00 +0200","slug":"first-contribution-to-mdn","content":"<p>The <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/\">MDN (Mozilla Developer Network) web docs</a>{:target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferer\"} are an awesome resource for every web developer.</p>\n<p>So naturally I regularly use MDN to check possible attributes, how an element can be used or on what browsers it is supported. While working on a small side project, I noticed, that the compatibility table of the <code>input[type=color]</code> element shows quite some browsers as \"Compatibility unknown\". Amongst others Edge. Since I already had a basic example of the input element available and I am working on a Windows machine I tried the example with Edge and sure enough, everything worked just fine.</p>\n<p>That's when I decided to try and improve MDN by contributing a small fix. But where to start? Luckily, each page has a big edit button at the top and works just like most other wikis. However, before you can edit a page, you need to sign in to your MDN profile. If you don't have one, you can sign in with GitHub and a MDN profile will automatically be created.</p>\n<p>After signing in and editing a page, you will see a huge RichText editor. The browser compatibility table is normally at the very bottom, but when you scroll there you will find a message along those lines:</p>\n<p>So the browser compatibility data is actually managed in a separate <a href=\"https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data\">git repository on GitHub</a>{:target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferer\"}. So let's head over to GitHub and check it out. The repository is quite nicely structured and really well documented. The <a href=\"https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data/blob/master/README.md\">README.md</a>{:target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferer\"} describes the structure of the repository and the <a href=\"CONTRIBUTING.md\">CONTRIBUTING.md</a>{:target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferer\"} explains what you should be aware of if you want to contribute.</p>\n<p>So I quickly browser through the open Pull Requests, but I didn't find anything for my specific issue. Great! So let's find out where we can make the necessary changes. And sure enough, we find the file <code>/html/elements/input/color.json</code> which contains the exact data we want to modify.</p>\n<p>The JSON structure is pretty straight forward. It contains an entry for each browser:</p>\n<pre><code>{\n    \"support\": {\n        \"chrome\": {\n            \"version_added\": \"20\"\n        },\n        \"chrome_android\": {\n            \"version_added\": null\n        },\n        \"edge\": {\n            \"version_added\": null\n        },\n        \"edge_mobile\": {\n            \"version_added\": null\n        }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>The <code>version_added</code> property can have four different states:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>string</strong>: The exact version when a browser started supporting the element/attribute</li>\n<li><strong>null</strong>: The compatibility is unknown</li>\n<li><strong>true</strong>: The browser supports it, but the exact version is unknown</li>\n<li><strong>false</strong>: The browser doesn't support it</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Okay so what shall we enter? <code>true</code>? That would be possible, but it would be neat if we know the actual version. Well, <a href=\"https://caniuse.com/#feat=input-color\">caniuse.com</a>{:target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferer\"} thinks that it is supported since version 14 and sure enough, we find a <a href=\"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/forums/257854-microsoft-edge-developer/suggestions/6514216--input-type-color\">Microsoft support ticket</a>{:target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferer\"} with an official response stating that it is indeed shipped since EdgeHTML 14.</p>\n<p>So what is there left to do? We simply fork the repository, edit the <code>color.json</code> file and enter <code>\"14\"</code> as the <code>version_added</code> for <code>edge</code> and <code>edge_mobile</code> and create the pull request. To ease the pain for the reviewers, we provide the link to the microsoft support ticket.</p>\n<p>And voil√†, we are finished. And not even 24 hours later, the pull request was successfully merged without any problems!</p>\n<p>So it is actually quite easy to contribute to most of the online developer resources these days. If you haven't tried it, I encourage you to take a look. Small patches and updates like this make the resource a little bit better and more valuable step by step!</p>\n<p>Read up on this topic:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web\">MDN web docs</a>{:target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferer\"}</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/MDN/Contribute/Editor\">MDN web docs contribution guide</a>{:target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferer\"}</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data\">MDN browser compatibility repository</a>{:target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferer\"}</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data/pull/2434\">My first PR to the compatibility repository</a>{:target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferer\"}</li>\n</ul>\n","url":"https://zlypher.github.io/posts/first-contribution-to-mdn"}},"__N_SSG":true}
