You want to restart it, but you discover, that it is stuck in either the state \"Starting\" or \"Stopping\". Unfortunately, all options are greyed out and you can neither start nor stop the service via the GUI.</p>\n<p>So how can we resolve this issue and get the service back up and running? Fortunately, there is a solution which has been found long ago (see further links) and is not that hard to execute. All you need to do is find the process id (PID) of the offending service and kill it via the command line.</p>\n<p>Find out the PID of the service. Just make sure to use the actual service name and not the display name!</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">> sc queryex &#x3C;SERVICE_NAME>\n</code></pre>\n<p>This will output some information about the service, including the process id.</p>\n<pre><code>C:\\Users\\Thomas>sc queryex Foo.Services.Bar\n\nSERVICE_NAME: Foo.Services.Bar\n        TYPE               : 10  WIN32_OWN_PROCESS\n        STATE              : 2 0 START_PENDING\n                                (NOT_STOPPABLE, NOT_PAUSABLE, IGNORES_SHUTDOWN)\n        WIN32_EXIT_CODE    : 0  (0x0)\n        SERVICE_EXIT_CODE  : 0  (0x0)\n        CHECKPOINT         : 0x0\n        WAIT_HINT          : 0x0\n        PID                : 3976\n        FLAGS              :\n</code></pre>\n<p>Kill the service.
