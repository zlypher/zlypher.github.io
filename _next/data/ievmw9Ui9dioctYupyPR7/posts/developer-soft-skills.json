He lists and explains ten non-technical topics, that had a clear positive impact on his career. I largely agree with his list and think that those skills would be very helpful, for all the developers I interact with on a daily basis. My top three skills from that list are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Initiative</li>\n<li>Continual Learning</li>\n<li>Clear Communication</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Want to go into more detail and find out about the remaining seven skills? Check out his article and let me know what you think!</p>\n","url":"https://zlypher.github.io/posts/developer-soft-skills"}},"__N_SSG":true}
