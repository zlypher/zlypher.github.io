Then this tool is for you!\n\nApart from that I took some time to create it and it would be awesome to hear what you think about it!\n\n## Why did I create it?\n\nI was following the chapters from [Craftin Interpreters by Bob Nystrom](http://www.craftinginterpreters.com/) for quite some time. So I was looking for a chance to implement this knowledge in a small app and boolean expressions seemed to be a reasonable choice for an interpreter.\n\nFurther Links:\n\n* [Bool GitHub Repository](https://zlypher.github.io/bool/)\n* [Crafting Interpreters TOC](http://www.craftinginterpreters.com/contents.html)","url":"https://www.tompka.io/posts/project-bool-checker"}},"__N_SSG":true}
