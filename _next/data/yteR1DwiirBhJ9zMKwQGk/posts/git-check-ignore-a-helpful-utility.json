But from what file and through which rule exactly? Luckily, it is possible to check that with `git check-ignore`.\n\nThe usage is quite straight forward. You pass it the path to a file. The command outputs the path if it is ignored.\n\n```sh\n> git check-ignore <pathname>\n> git check-ignore -v <pathname>\n```\n\nIf you use the verbose option `-v`, the command will additionally output, the exclude pattern that matched the path as well as the `.gitignore` file and the exact line number.\n\n```sh\n> git check-ignore -v .vscode/settings.json\n.gitignore:4:.vscode    .vscode/settings.json\n```\n\n**Resources**\n\n* [Git - git-check-ignore Documentation](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-check-ignore)","url":"https://www.tompka.io/posts/git-check-ignore-a-helpful-utility"}},"__N_SSG":true}
