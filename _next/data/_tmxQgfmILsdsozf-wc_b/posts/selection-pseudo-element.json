If you are on Chrome/Windows, this will most likely be a dark blue background and a white text color. Did you know, that you can change this styling via CSS? The magic word is `::selection` and as a matter of fact, it is quite [well supported across all browsers](https://caniuse.com/#feat=css-selection).\n\nThe `::selection` pseudo element allows you to style the highlighted text. This is actually quite simple:\n\n```css\n::selection {\n    background-color: #130BB0;\n    color: #EFF5F5;\n}\n```\n\nPretty straight forward. Checkout [this CodePen](https://codepen.io/zlypher/pen/yZQBbg) and play around to get a feeling how it works. However, only a few css properties are supported on the `::selection` pseudo element:\n* color\n* background-color\n* cursor\n* caret-color\n* outline\n* text-decoration\n* text-emphasis-color\n* text-shadow\n\nJust don't forget about Accessibility and be sure to pick a [sufficient contrast ration](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/). So experiment and play around with it. It can add a nice touch to your website.\n\n**Resources**\n* [::selection CodePen](https://codepen.io/zlypher/pen/yZQBbg)\n* [::selection](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/::selection)\n* [caniuse ::selection CSS pseudo-element](https://caniuse.com/#feat=css-selection)","url":"https://zlypher.github.io/posts/selection-pseudo-element"}},"__N_SSG":true}
