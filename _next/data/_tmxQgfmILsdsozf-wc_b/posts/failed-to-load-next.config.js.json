Locally, running `next build` still worked fine. However, my GitHub Actions started to fail with the message \"Failed to load next.config.js\".\n\n![Error output saying: Failed to load next.config.js](/assets/images/failed-to-load-next-config-js.png)\n\nAfter searching and finding [this issue on GitHub](https://github.com/colbyfayock/next-wordpress-starter/issues/274), it was clear that there seemed to be an issue with the Node version, as [Next.js requires at least Node.js 12.22.0 or later](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started#system-requirements). Luckily, the [setup-node action](https://github.com/actions/setup-node), provides the possibility to specify the node-version which should be used. By default it uses the node version from PATH. This was `v10.24.1` in my case.\n\nI could resolve my issue by specifying at least a fixed major version like that:\n\n```\n- name: Install and Build\n  uses: actions/setup-node@v2\n  with:\n    node-version: \"16\"\n```\n","url":"https://zlypher.github.io/posts/failed-to-load-next.config.js"}},"__N_SSG":true}
