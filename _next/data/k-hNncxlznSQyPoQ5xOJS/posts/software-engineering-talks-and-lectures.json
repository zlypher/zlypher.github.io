Now the main problem lies in the discovery of the most interesting ones. There are literally hundreds of videos available via YouTube and other platforms.\n\nSo I made a resolution for 2019 to watch at least 1 hour worth of talks each week. The most interesting ones, which inspired me or taught me something new, will be collected in a curated playlist on YouTube as well as on my blog. So stay tuned for some awesome software engineering talks! You can find most of the list, with a short description of each video, on the new [\"Talks\" page](/talks) or you can checkout the [YouTube playlist \"Software Engineering Talks and Lectures\"](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLl0AtsmuedN4lbpkR8lg1hyE-ZCrh9ebd).\n\nDo you have some favourite talks? Send me a suggestion and I'll be happy to check it out!","url":"https://www.tompka.io/posts/software-engineering-talks-and-lectures"}},"__N_SSG":true}
