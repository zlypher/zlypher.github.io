The page you are linking to gains partial access to your tab via `window.opener`. However, there is a pretty simple workaround. You can prevent this by specifying `rel=\"noopener noreferrer` on your links. Even [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) emits a warning, if you forget to specify the `rel` attribute:\n\n```bash\nUsing target=\"_blank\" without rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" is a security risk: see https://mathiasbynens.github.io/rel-noopener  react/jsx-no-target-blank\n```\n\nThere are actually a lot of blog posts going into great lengths explaining the details of this security vulnerability.
