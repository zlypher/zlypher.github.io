Locally, running <code>next build</code> still worked fine. However, my GitHub Actions started to fail with the message \"Failed to load next.config.js\".</p>\n<p>After searching and finding <a href=\"https://github.com/colbyfayock/next-wordpress-starter/issues/274\">this issue on GitHub</a>, it was clear that there seemed to be an issue with the Node version, as <a href=\"https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started#system-requirements\">Next.js requires at least Node.js 12.22.0 or later</a>. Luckily, the <a href=\"https://github.com/actions/setup-node\">setup-node action</a>, provides the possibility to specify the node-version which should be used. By default it uses the node version from PATH. This was <code>v10.24.1</code> in my case.</p>\n<p>I could resolve my issue by specifying at least a fixed major version like that:</p>\n<pre><code>- name: Install and Build\n  uses: actions/setup-node@v2\n  with:\n    node-version: \"16\"\n</code></pre>\n","url":"https://zlypher.github.io/posts/failed-to-load-next.config.js"}},"__N_SSG":true}
