So why do we need another one (_Hint: this one_)?\n\nWell to be completely honest, there are two reasons behind this blog:\n\n1. If you browse around the web und look for hints, what a successfull Software Engineer should do, you find (among others) the following statements: _\"Build an online presence\"_, _\"Give back to the community, by helping others\"_ or _\"Get a reputation by presenting your skills\"_. Therefore, I aim to fulfill these requirements by writing this blog.\n\n2. I am quite forgetful about some techniques or problems I encounter and solve during my day to day work. So this website doubles as some kind of diary or writeup, so that I can reflect on what I have learned so far and get feedback from everyone else.\n\nI am happy, that you took some time to read one or more pages of this blog and I gladly hear your opinion and I encourage you to give me feedback.","url":"https://www.tompka.io/posts/not-another-developer-blog"}},"__N_SSG":true}
