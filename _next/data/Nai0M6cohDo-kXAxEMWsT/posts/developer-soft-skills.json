I largely agree with his list and think that those skills would be very helpful, for all the developers I interact with on a daily basis. My top three skills from that list are:\n\n1. Initiative\n2. Continual Learning\n3. Clear Communication\n\nWant to go into more detail and find out about the remaining seven skills?
