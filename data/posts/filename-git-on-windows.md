Today I wanted to manually deploy a [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) project to Github Pages. Now, normally this happens via Travis CI after each build, but this time I wanted to manually verify something. Luckily, this is pretty easy with CRA. If you installed the "gh-pages" packages and added the required script to package.json you only need to execute the deploy script and you are good to go.

## The Problem

But this time, I ran into a rather strange problem:

```bash

```

If you read the log carefully, you will see that the script "gh-pages -d build" fails. Even "git checkout gh-pages" fails with the same error.

Now if you've already used Travis CI to deploy th GH pages, you will be aware, that it creates a file with the timestamp of the deployment. In this example this files is conveniently named "Mon Sep 25 18:25:02 UTC 2017 by Deployment Bot (from Travis CI)".

## The Solution

As it turns out, Windows really dislikes colons (":") in file names and prohibits them. So git can't create the file during checkout of the branch and fails with an "Invalid argument". In my case, manually deleting the file via github.com resolved the issue. Afterwards, the deployment script completed successfully.
