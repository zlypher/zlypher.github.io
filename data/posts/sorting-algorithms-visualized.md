Lately I have been renewing my knowledge of different sorting algorithms. During my studies I came across this neat [visualization of 8 different sorting algorithms on Toptal](https://www.toptal.com/developers/sorting-algorithms).

They visually demonstrate how these algorithms operate on different kinds of data sets like random input, nearly sorted input or reversely sorted input. From these different variations you can see, that there is no true best sorting algorithms. But each one has different strengths and weaknesses.

Be sure to check it out and give it a try!
