There are quite a lot of different tools and scanners out there for us web developers, to monitor best practices on our websites. Another one of those scanners - and pretty new at that - is [webhint.io](https://webhint.io). It features an online scanner as well as a cli tool (neatly packaged via npm) which you can run locally or on your build servers.

Currently, it tests for various issues in the categories:
* Accessibility
* Interoperability
* PWA
* Performance
* Security

But will it kill/replace Lighthouse and similar tools? Frankly, I don't know and I am not 100% convinced about it yet either. But it definitely looks promising, so keep an eye on it!
