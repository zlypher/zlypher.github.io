If you are using VS Code and working with code formatters like [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) regularly, this extension might come in handy. If everything is setup correctly, the code formatters are straight forward and help tremendously. However, sometimes you might need to disable them, because they contradict some linter rules or are not setup correctly in a different project.

That's where the [Formatting Toggle](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tombonnike.vscode-status-bar-format-toggle) extension helps. It's statement is simple:
