Christmas time is here. Work is going slow. There is not a lot of stuff to do. If that applies to you and you enjoy a programming challenge, then I have news for you! Check out this years version of [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)! Each day a new puzzle will be published with two parts. You can earn stars for each completed puzzle and even compete on a leaderboard (the first 100 solutions receive more stars).

The author, [Eric Wastl](http://was.tl/), puts in a lot of effort into Advent of Code each year. So show him some love and spread the word!

<blockquote class="c-quote" cite="https://adventofcode.com/2019/about">
Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other.

I will also join in on the fun and publish my solutions on GitHub at [zlypher/advent-of-code](https://github.com/zlypher/advent-of-code). However, I am already a few days behind, so don't count on it being completely up to date.

If you are stuck or simply want to exchange some thoughts and solutions with other people, I encourage you to check out the [Advent of Code on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/). Don't be intimidated though, there are some impressive solutions posted.
