Checkout my new small [side project "Bool Checker"](https://zlypher.github.io/bool/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferer"}.

## What does it do?

"Bool Checker" basically takes a boolean expression like `a && b` or `foo || (bar && baz)` and determines, what these expressions would evaluate to if you pass `true/false` to the respective elements.

## Why should I try it?

You might have some complex boolean expressions in your codebase and you don't want to waste a lot of time to figure out what they would evaluate to? Then this tool is for you!

Apart from that I took some time to create it and it would be awesome to hear what you think about it!

## Why did I create it?

I was following the chapters from [Craftin Interpreters by Bob Nystrom](http://www.craftinginterpreters.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferer"} for quite some time. So I was looking for a chance to implement this knowledge in a small app and boolean expressions seemed to be a reasonable choice for an interpreter.
