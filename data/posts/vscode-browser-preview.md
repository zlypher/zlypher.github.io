Recently, a new interesting VS Code extension has been added to the Marketplace: [Browser Preview](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=auchenberg.vscode-browser-preview). As the name suggests, it enables you to have a Google Chrome window inside your VS Code instance! That's pretty neat! Apart from that, it is also debuggable via the [Debugger for Chrome](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=msjsdiag.debugger-for-chrome).

Currently, it is still in preview and some users are reporting performance and usability issues. However, it is under active development and an interesting project. I'll definitely keep an eye on it. Be sure to give it a try and support the author if you like it!
