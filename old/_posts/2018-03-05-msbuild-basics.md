Ever wondered what stands behind Visual Studio that creates the actual application from your source files? Want to find out, what all the magic stuff in the `csproj` files really means?

Luckily for you, I just added a new [GitHub repository "MSBuild Basics"](https://github.com/zlypher/msbuild-basics){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferer"} which covers all the basic information!

* What is MSBuild?
* What is the stuff in the `csproj`?
* How does it work together?
* And how can you make it run to your liking?

Find it out in my repository [zlypher/msbuild-basics](https://github.com/zlypher/msbuild-basics){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferer"}. Created in collaboration with [TheDarkEye666](https://github.com/TheDarkEye666){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferer"}. If you find any problems, please leave an Issue or a Pull Request.
