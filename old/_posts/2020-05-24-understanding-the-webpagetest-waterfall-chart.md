If you earn a living developing websites, one of your considerations should be website performance. An invaluable tool for investigating performance issues and finding bottlenecks is [WebPageTest](https://www.webpagetest.org/).

If you are wondering what all those charts, lines and colors mean, be sure to read this awesome article ["Reading a WebPageTest Waterfall Chart"](https://calendar.perfplanet.com/2019/reading-a-webpagetest-waterfall-chart/) from Matt Hobbs. He explains every little piece of WebPageTest and helps you kickstart your web performance debugging capabilities with WebPageTest.
