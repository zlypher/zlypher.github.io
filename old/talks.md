I strongly believe, that conference talks and lectures are an invaluable tool to find inspiration as well as learn bits and pieces of new technologies, skills and features. However, with conferences every month and every week, there is an almost unlimited amount of material available. So I created a curated playlist with engineering talks on YouTube, that I think are exceptionally interesting. The playlist will mainly focus on general Software Engineering as well as web technologies.

Checkout out the complete ["Software Engineering Talks and Lectures" playlist on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLl0AtsmuedN4lbpkR8lg1hyE-ZCrh9ebd).

## Talks and Lectures

### "Uncle" Bob Martin - "The Future of Programming"

### React Today and Tomorrow and 90% Cleaner React With Hooks

First anouncement and introduction of React Hooks by Sophie Alpert, Dan Abramov, and Ryan Florence. They outline the problem the React team was trying to solve and provide an easy to follow showcase for for React Hooks compared to a traditional approach with class components.

### Seven Ineffective Coding Habits of Many Programmers

Interesting talk by Kevlin Henney about several coding habits, that one normally doesn't think about. He gives his opinion on what properties constitute good, readable code. Topics he covers include Unsustainable Spacing, Lego Naming and Underabstraction. Unfortunately, the camera editing is a bit lackluster and not all slides are shown properly. Still a great talk, which makes you think a little bit more about details of every day programming.
