If you are interested in how the magic behind react works and what it takes to build your own basic version of react, be sure to check out [Build your own React on pomb.us](https://pomb.us/build-your-own-react/).

It is a fantastic read. You will learn to build your own react from the ground up. Starting with the `createElement` and `render` function and working your way up to function components and even hooks. A fair warning though, you will need a bit of time to go through the whole article. However, as a bonus you will find one of the best ways to present evolving code that I have seen in a long time.
