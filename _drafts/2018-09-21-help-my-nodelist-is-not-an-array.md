Let's say, that you have to find a list of all links on a page. This is a fairly basic task and can be solved in different ways. For our purposes, using Vanilla JS, we could either use `document.getElementsByTagName` or `document.querySelectorAll`. While the former returns a `HTMLCollection`, the latter returns a `NodeList`. They are similar enough for our example, so we'll go with `querySelectorAll`. Our code will look something like this:

```js
let elements = document.querySelectorAll("a")
> NodeList(3)Â [a, a, a]

let elements = document.getElementsByTagName("a")
> HTMLCollection(3) [a, a, a]
```

That looks promising! As a next step, we want to get the `"href"` attribute from each link. So that we end up with a list of urls that page links to. Since we are well versed developers and want to use a functional approach, we use the `map` function. As a reminder, the map function will execute the callback for each element in the array and create a new array from the return values. Combined, with arrow functions, we get some concise, expressive code:

```js
let links = elements.map(elem => elem.getAttribute("href"));
```

However, that will result in a nasty TypeError: `Uncaught TypeError: document.querySelectorAll(...).map is not a function`. But why? Both the `NodeList` and the `HtmlCollection` look like arrays and can even access single items with `elements[index]`. As it turns out, there are [iterable objects](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Iteration_protocols) as well as "array-like objects". Array-like objects have a `length` properties and can access elements via an index, but don't have all the methods, that natural arrays have. Which is precisely the case with `NodeList` and `HtmlCollection`.

There are two quick and easy solutions (probably more, but those should be sufficient) to solve this problem:

## Array.from

<blockquote class="c-quote" cite="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/from">"The Array.from() method creates a new, shallow-copied Array instance from an array-like or iterable object."</blockquote>

`"Array.from"` is a new built-in function (in ES6, polyfills for IE are available), which can convert the `NodeList` and other objects into actual arrays. With that, we are now able to finally use the map function to implement our logic.

```js
let elements = document.querySelectorAll("a");
let links = Array.from(elements).map(elem => elem.getAttribute("href"));
```

## Spread/Rest operator

The second solution utilizes the new spread and rest operators. By extracting the elements of a `NodeList` and immediately spreading it into a new array.

```js
let elements = document.querySelectorAll("a");
let links = [...elements].map(elem => elem.getAttribute("href"));
```
