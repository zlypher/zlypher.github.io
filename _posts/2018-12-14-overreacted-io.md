I have some great news for everyone interested in the internals of React and JavaScript in general! [Dan Abramov](https://mobile.twitter.com/dan_abramov), one of the software engineers behind [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/), started his own personal blog since the end of November. Ever wondered, how React can tell the difference between a Class from a Function? Or how `setState` knows what it should do? Then definitely check out his posts on [Overreacted](https://overreacted.io) and follow him on [Twitter](https://mobile.twitter.com/dan_abramov)!
