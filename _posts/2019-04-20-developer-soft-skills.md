Today I stumbled over this great article ["Ten Soft Skills That Will Shape Your Career"](https://benmccormick.org/2019/04/15/soft-skills) by Ben McCormick. He lists and explains ten non-technical topics, that had a clear positive impact on his career. I largely agree with his list and think that those skills would be very helpful, for all the developers I interact with on a daily basis. My top three skills from that list are:

1. Initiative
2. Continual Learning
3. Clear Communication

Want to go into more detail and find out about the remaining seven skills? Check out his article and let me know what you think!
